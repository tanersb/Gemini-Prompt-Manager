First, analyze the subject’s outfit and accessories and identify the dominant and secondary colors present in the clothing (dress, jacket, shoes, jewelry, bags, etc.). Use these detected colors as the primary color palette for the flowers.  Fill the entire lower section of the scene with a thick, overflowing layer of real flowers, creating the feeling that the subject is standing inside a high-end indoor floral installation. The flowers should be extremely abundant, tightly packed, and layered with strong depth — covering the floor and rising upward around the subject.  Include a wide range of photorealistic flower types such as roses, peonies, ranunculus, tulips, daisies, hydrangeas, wildflowers, and lush greenery. The majority of flowers must match the dominant clothing and accessory colors, with subtle variations in tone and shade. Minor accent flowers in neutral or complementary tones (ivory, soft green, muted pastels) are allowed only for depth and realism — not to override the main color scheme.  The overall floral arrangement should feel rich, immersive, and cohesive, with flowers placed in the foreground, midground, and background, wrapping naturally around the subject.  Ensure all flowers look real and fresh, with detailed petal textures, soft natural lighting, and shadows that precisely match the original image. Perspective, scale, and depth must be physically accurate, with seamless integration into the environment — no flat, artificial, or pasted appearance.  The flowers should rise densely around the subject’s legs and fill the scene, but must never cover the face or distort the body or clothing silhouette.  Do not add any props, text, or alter any existing elements — the only modification allowed is the addition of flowers.  Objective: Transform the scene into a luxurious, ultra-dense, photorealistic floral installation where the flower colors are driven by the subject’s outfit and accessories, while fully preserving the original subject and environment.` },

Include British Shorthairs, Scottish Folds, Maine Coons, Persians, tabby cats, and mixed-breed domestic cats in realistic tones: whites, creams, browns, soft grays, ginger tones, tabby markings, and subtle spotted or striped patterns. Place the cats in a way that feels crowded yet believable:  • several gathered closely around the subject’s feet  • small clusters sitting or gently hopping nearby  • a number of cats filling the background or midground, spaced in a natural, organic way  • some peeking from behind objects or slightly overlapping others, like a real cat-filled environment  • overall density should feel high, but physically plausible Ensure all cats match the lighting, shadows, color temperature, and perspective of the original scene so they appear naturally integrated. Fur should be soft and textured, but never over-rendered or artificial. The overall mood should feel warm, joyful, and cat-filled in a realistic but abundant way — like stumbling into a naturally crowded outdoor cat gathering or a cozy indoor space with many bunnies.

Create a 1x2 vertical grid couple winter scene:  Top Frame: • Couple close together, leaning heads with gentle smiles • Snowy forest in the background • Cinematic winter atmosphere, soft falling snow • Sharp focus on faces, shallow depth of field  Bottom Frame: • Same couple facing each other closely • Romantic eye contact, natural soft expressions • Snowflakes visible on hair & clothes • Blue-ish cold tones, cozy feeling, cinematic lighting  Global Rules: • Keep original pose inspiration, proportions, gender, accessories, hair color, and clothing type • Add winter elements only breath mist if needed • Highly-realistic photography, 4K quality • Background always snowy outdoors  Negative Prompt: no new characters, no distortions, no cartoon style, no pose anomalies  ——————-——————-——————-  Use (REFERENCE IMAGE) as identity and pose reference. Keep the original faces and clothing silhouettes but:  • Add matching thick red scarves to both • Add falling snow and visible frosty breath • Background: snowy forest with soft bokeh • Couple holding a heart-shaped snowball together • Warm romantic mood, intimate connection • Skin and hair detailed, realistic lighting  Negative Prompt: no glove mismatches, no changing facial identity, no unrealistic props` }
